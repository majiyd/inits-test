In this simple project, i'll be improving on my k
nowledge of Redux. I'll make a simple contact list app.<br>
  
I'll be making use of
1. React
2. Redux
3. Css Modules
4. [Mockapi.io](https://www.mockapi.io) - used to fake real lifeAPI

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get the code, clone the repo <br>
```
git clone https://github.com/majiyd/contact-app.git
```
then run  
```
npm install
```
and
```
npm start
```
this runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.<br>
